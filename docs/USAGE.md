## 1. Core Features

TSF Droid leverages a hybrid execution flow to run tasks reliably:
* **Direct Command Aliasing**: Common phrases (e.g., "toggle flashlight", "settings", "detect routines") are intercepted and resolved locally without needing an LLM call.
* **Structured Planning**: Complex queries (e.g., "take a screenshot and message it to Dad on Telegram") are planned by an LLM into sequential steps.
* **Self-Contained Actions**: Critical intents (Calls, WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS) do not require opening their apps first. The agent handles deep links or fallback intents natively.
* **Action Auto-Mapper**: Automatically corrects minor typo variations or hallucinated actions before execution.

## 3. Habit & Routine Detection

TSF Droid automatically detects repeated usage patterns and offers one-click routine automations.

### How Habit Mining Works:
* **Background Observation**: As you use your device normally, TSF Droid records app switches and times of day.
* **Pattern Detection**: When a sequence of actions repeats (e.g. every weekday at 9:00 AM you open *Gmail $\to$ Calendar $\to$ Slack $\to$ Chrome*), TSF Droid generates a suggested routine.
* **Proactive Card**: *"I noticed you usually do these tasks every weekday morning. Would you like me to automate them?"*

### Routine Commands:
* **`GET_MORNING_BRIEFING`**: Composes a structured morning briefing with calendar events, unread notifications, and task reminders.
  * *Parameters*: `section` (`"full"`, `"schedule"`, `"notifications"`), `speak` (`"true"`/`"false"`).
* **`RUN_ROUTINE`**: Executes an approved automated routine by name or ID (*"Run morning routine"*).
* **`DETECT_ROUTINES`**: Analyzes recent habit history on demand (*"Detect routines"*).
* **`APPROVE_ROUTINE`**: Approves a suggested habit routine and converts it into a scheduled macro (*"Approve morning routine"*).

## 4. Screen Understanding & Memory ("Read & Remember")

Extract and remember important information directly from your screen:

* **`READ_AND_REMEMBER_SCREEN`**: Captures screen contents (via vision model + accessibility tree) and extracts meeting dates, locations, action items, or notes directly into memory.
  * *Examples*: *"Read this screen and save the meeting to my notes"*, *"Remember this WhatsApp message"*.
* **`RECALL_MEMORY`**: Queries saved screen notes, facts, and memories using semantic natural language search.
  * *Examples*: *"What did I save about the team meeting?"*, *"Read my notes about flight details"*.

3. **📈 Level 3 (Learned Patterns)**: Inferred behaviors with dynamic confidence scoring (50% $\to$ 85% $\to$ 95%).
4. **🔒 Level 4 (Sensitive Data)**: Confidential secrets (passwords, PINs) encrypted with Android Keystore AES-256-GCM.

### Knowledge Commands:
* **`QUERY_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH`**: *"What are my favorite music apps?"*, *"What are my active routines?"*
* **`UPDATE_PREFERENCE`**: *"Set my preferred ride app to Uber"*.
