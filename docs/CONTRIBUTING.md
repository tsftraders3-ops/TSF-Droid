# Contributing to TSF Droid

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TSF Droid! We welcome community contributions to help improve the agent's performance, stability, and compatibility.

> **"Don't just write it. Prove it works."**

If you're contributing code, you're a **VibeCoder** — someone who doesn't ship assumptions, but ships battle-tested, real-world-proven features.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Fork** the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2.  Set up the Android development environment (Android Studio, JDK 21 exactly).
    The build targets Java 21 (`jvmToolchain(21)`), and `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`
    pins the Gradle daemon to JDK 21.
3.  Ensure the Android build runs successfully:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    ```

## 🤖 Model Requirement: Opus 4.8+ Level

All contributors to TSF Droid **must** use a **frontier-class AI model** — Claude Opus 4.8 or equivalent tier — when:

| Activity | Why Opus 4.8+ |
|----------|---------------|
| Writing new Actions | Frontier models understand Android accessibility APIs, edge cases, and multi-step planning far better than smaller models |
| Debugging agent failures | Complex reasoning chains require a model that can hold the full execution context |
| Designing multi-step workflows | Only frontier models reliably decompose "send a WhatsApp message AND set an alarm" into correct sequential steps |
| Reviewing PRs | Opus-level models catch subtle logic errors, race conditions, and missing error handling that smaller models miss |
| Writing tests & scenarios | Generating realistic, adversarial test scenarios requires deep understanding of real-world phone usage |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why not a smaller model?** TSF Droid is an *autonomous agent* — a single missed edge case can send the wrong message to the wrong person, delete data, or brick a user's workflow. The cost of frontier reasoning is a rounding error compared to the cost of shipping broken autonomy.

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style
*   Follow standard **Kotlin Style Guide** conventions.
*   Keep functions small, focused, and well-tested.
*   Ensure all actions implement the standard `Action` interface and handle error states gracefully (returning clean `ActionResult`s instead of crashing).

### Adding Actions
If you are implementing a new action:
1.  Add it to the corresponding action group class under `app/src/main/java/com/tsfdroid/ai/actions/`.
2.  Register the action inside the list returned by `getActions()`.
3.  Add aliases in `AliasResolver.kt` if the action is commonly triggered via basic voice commands.
4.  Add appropriate test coverage where applicable.

## 🧪 The Golden Rule: Always Test the Scenario

**Every feature you integrate MUST be tested against real-world scenarios before submitting a PR.**

This is non-negotiable. If you add a capability, you prove it works end-to-end.

### 📱 Mandatory Test Scenarios

#### 1. WhatsApp Message Sending
```
Scenario: "Send a WhatsApp message to John saying I'll be 10 minutes late"
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ WhatsApp opens correctly
- ✅ Correct contact is selected (not a similarly-named contact)
- ✅ Message text is entered accurately — no truncation, no typos
- ✅ Message is actually sent (not just typed and left unsent)
- ✅ Agent confirms success or reports failure gracefully
- ✅ Works when WhatsApp is already open on a different chat
- ✅ Works when the contact has multiple numbers

**Edge cases to test:**
- Contact not found → agent should inform the user, NOT send to a random contact
- No internet → agent should detect and report, not hang silently
- WhatsApp not installed → graceful fallback or clear error message

---

#### 2. Email Composition & Sending
```
Scenario: "Email my boss the quarterly report summary with subject 'Q3 Update'"
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Email app opens (Gmail, Outlook, or default mail client)
- ✅ Recipient field is populated correctly
- ✅ Subject line matches the user's request exactly
- ✅ Body content is composed accurately
- ✅ Email is sent (not left as a draft)
- ✅ Attachments are handled if mentioned

**Edge cases to test:**
- Multiple email accounts configured → correct account is used
- Recipient not in contacts → manual email entry works
- Long email body → no truncation or loss of content
- CC/BCC handling when requested

---

#### 3. Complex Multi-Step Tasks
```
Scenario: "Check if it's going to rain tomorrow, and if so, text my wife that
I'll pick up the kids, then set an alarm for 5:30 PM"
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Task is decomposed into correct sequential steps
- ✅ Conditional logic is respected (only texts if rain is predicted)
- ✅ Each step verifies its own success before proceeding
- ✅ If Step 2 fails, Step 3 still attempts (unless dependent)
- ✅ Final summary reports what was done and what wasn't
- ✅ Re-planning kicks in if an intermediate step fails

**Edge cases to test:**
- Weather API returns ambiguous data → agent handles uncertainty
- SMS app not set as default → agent adapts
- Alarm time is in the past → agent clarifies with user
- One step succeeds but another fails → partial completion is reported clearly

---

#### 4. Your Custom Feature
```
Scenario: Whatever YOUR feature does — test it like a real user would.
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Happy path works flawlessly
- ✅ All error states are handled (no crashes, no silent failures)
- ✅ Accessibility service interactions are clean (no orphaned UI states)
- ✅ Feature works alongside existing features (no regressions)
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (no 30-second hangs)
- ✅ The agent's natural language response makes sense to a non-technical user

## 🔁 The VibeCoder Testing Loop

Every PR must follow this loop before submission:

## 🚫 What Gets Your PR Rejected

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Rejected |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "It works on my end" with no proof | We need reproducible test evidence |
| Tested only the happy path | Real users hit edge cases constantly |
| Used a small/fast model for complex logic | Frontier models catch errors that smaller models miss |
| No test report in the PR | If you didn't document it, it didn't happen |
| Feature breaks existing scenarios | Regressions are unacceptable in an autonomous agent |
| Silent failures (no error message to user) | Users must always know what happened and why |

## 🧠 The VibeCoder Mindset

```
A VibeCoder doesn't ask "does it compile?"
A VibeCoder asks "would I trust this to send a message to my boss?"
```

We're building an agent that **acts on behalf of real people** on their most personal device. Every action we ship has the potential to:

- 📩 Send a message to the wrong person
- 🗑️ Delete something that shouldn't be deleted
- ⏰ Set an alarm at the wrong time
- 📧 Email the wrong content to the wrong recipient

**This is why we demand frontier-model reasoning and exhaustive real-world testing.** Not because we're perfectionists — because our users are trusting us with their digital lives.
