# Ticket sweep handoff — 2026-07-29


> **STATUS NOTE (v1.3.0, 2026-10-01, TSF-Droid fork):** This handoff was
> written against the upstream `JMAN730/opendroid` tracker and predates the
> TSF fork's v1.0–v1.3.0 development. Most of it landed in the fork, via
> different code than the ticket proposed: #46 (raw 401 bodies) is fixed by
> `toSafeProviderException` with known-secrets scrubbing in every provider
> (tested in `ProviderErrorDetailTest`); #33/#28 (fake streaming, dead
> safety net) were fixed by the real SSE rewrite — every provider pumps real
> deltas now; #31 (chat error surfacing) landed as `ChatErrorUiState`
> (tested); #30 (fractional durations) is fixed in `DurationParser` with
> regression tests; #32 (connection testing) no longer leans on
> `isAvailable()`; #42 (CI gaps) — unit tests + lint gate every push and the
> E2E suite runs on an API-34 emulator. Upstream-process tickets (#24, #34,
> PR #36/#38 merge order) are moot in the fork. Treat anything unmentioned
> here as history.
Session goal: close every open ticket on the fork (`JMAN730/opendroid`), one fresh agent
session per ticket, grilling tickets self-grilled, PRs opened at the end.

Stopped early: the machine could not carry the parallel agent load. This file records
exactly where the work stands so it can be resumed on the workstation without re-deriving
anything.

**Tracker note.** `AGENTS.md` makes the fork the only issue tracker; `yashab-cyber/opendroid`
is off limits. `gh` defaults to upstream when both remotes are present, so every `gh issue`
and `gh pr` command below passes `--repo JMAN730/opendroid` explicitly, and `gh api` calls
carry the repository in the endpoint path instead. The two upstream bug reports (#13 "API
Failer", #9 "LOCAL IMPORT NOT WORKING") are the *origin* of this work but are not the
tracker — upstream #13 is what map #25 exists to fix.

## Done

Six design tickets closed, each with its full reasoning posted as a comment before closing:

| Ticket | Subject |
|---|---|
| #22 | Prototype the grant-all panel states |
| #23 | Define the JVM test surface for the permission model |
| #30 | Retry policy for transient provider failures |
| #33 | Streaming error propagation contract |
| #39 | Fate of executeWithFallback |
| #40 | Key redaction rule and Gemini key transport |

Both map bodies (#25, #18) have been updated with a "Decisions so far" entry per closed
ticket. Map #25's established-facts list also had a **factual error corrected** — see below.

Two open PRs received real commits before the session ended:

- **PR #36** (`JMAN730/implement-crash-log`) — `5b2c843 fix: redact credentials from crash
  records at capture time`, on top of a merge of `upstream/main`.
- **PR #38** (`JMAN730/to-spec-branch-name`) — three commits: `c47b372` migrate retired
  Claude 4.x/2.x IDs instead of forwarding them, `c6654bf` reset an unsupported Claude
  selection even when the model cache is fresh, `20b3121` surface Claude config errors as
  instructions rather than exception dumps.

Neither PR was merged and neither issue was closed — that is deliberate, they are yours to
review.

## Findings that outrank the ticket work

### 1. Live credential leak on `main` (from #40)

`OpenAIProvider.kt:65` interpolates the raw 401 response body into an `IOException`. Per
#27, that body echoes the key's **real first 8 and last 4 characters** — key material, not a
mask. The string then reaches:

- logcat
- the persisted `task_history` table (`AgentLoop.kt:593`)
- the in-app Logs screen, verbatim (`LogsScreen.kt:436-449`)
- a persisted chat message (`OpenAIProvider.kt:102` -> `AgentLoop.kt:442`)

and then **leaves the device**, because `AgentLoop.kt:413` feeds the last 10 chat messages
into the next `LLMRequest` (`:435`) — potentially to a different vendor than the key belongs
to.

Minimal fix: drop `$responseBody` from the throw in all 11 cloud providers. Not yet done —
it was queued behind PR #38 to avoid colliding in `ClaudeProvider.kt`. Tracked as **#46**.

### 2. Cross-vendor data exfiltration (from #39)

`CustomOpenAIProvider.isAvailable()` returns `true` unconditionally (`:103`) while its URL
defaults to `api.openai.com/v1` (`:38`). A user who selects Claude without a Claude key has
their traffic POSTed to OpenAI with an empty bearer — and that traffic includes a contact's
notification body (`AutoReplyEngine.kt:207`) and screenshots (`VisionEngine.kt:105`), not
just chat prompts.

### 3. Merge-order constraint

**PR #36 must not merge ahead of the redaction work.** The crash log ships a Share button
that dumps `Throwable.message` plus a 16k stack trace verbatim — `Throwable.message` is
exactly the carrier in finding 1. The `5b2c843` commit addresses capture-time redaction;
verify it covers the Share path before merging.

### 4. Map #25 contained a wrong premise

The map asserted that `executeWithFallback` (`LLMProviderFactory.kt:104`) ships the
cross-provider fallback. It has **zero call sites** and has never run. The live substitution
is `getActiveProvider` (`LLMProviderFactory.kt:92-102`), reached from all 8 LLM entry
points, and it triggers on a *missing key* rather than on failure. Map body now corrected.

### 5. Smaller bugs found, recorded on tickets, not fixed

- `DurationParser.kt` mis-parses `2m59.56s` as 176s — wrong `Retry-After` waits (#30).
- `streamComplete` is fake: it calls `complete()` first (`OpenAIProvider.kt:89-104`), so
  nothing actually streams today (#33).
- #28's safety net at `LLMProviderFactory.kt:147` catches nothing, because `streamComplete`
  returns a cold Flow — it must be Flow operators (#33).
- The unit-test CI (`b5dbc5c`) lives on the unmerged `implement-crash-log` branch, **not**
  `main`, so the test suite is not a merge gate yet (#23).

## Remaining work, in dependency order

14 issues still open, counting #46 filed for the security fix. `blocked_by` below is
GitHub's native issue-dependency state.

### Ready now, no blockers

- **#31** Chat error surfacing (`wayfinder:prototype`) — blocks #34 and #43. Must build on
  #33 (partial-text-then-error is a distinct render state; `NetworkErrorFormatter` retires
  into this ticket; agent row inserts lazily on first chunk), #40 (details block shows
  reconstructed allowlisted fields, never the raw body) and #30 (retry 1 silent, retry 2
  visible via `AgentState.Thinking`).
- **#32** Connection testing (`wayfinder:prototype`) — blocks #34. Cannot lean on
  `isAvailable()` at all (finding 2). Inherits the sole benchmark writer now that
  `updateLatencyBenchmark` dies with `getFallbackChain` (#39). Retry is off here (#30).
- **#24** Assemble the Grant-all spec and post it to issue 15 — **now unblocked**, both
  #22 and #23 closed. This is the last child of map #18.
- **#37** `@Embedded DeviceMetadata` refactor — stacks on PR #36's branch. The stated
  acceptance criterion is verifying Room emits the *same twelve column names*, because
  `DatabaseModule.kt:44` sets `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` and a mismatch silently
  drops the user's database rather than failing loudly.
- **#42** CI coverage gaps — stacks on PR #36's branch. Suggested order in the ticket:
  Robolectric migration test, lint + baseline, unsigned `assembleRelease`. The manual device
  smoke test and the `androidTest` source set cannot be done headless.
- **#46** Strip raw response bodies from exceptions in all 11 cloud providers. This is
  finding 1 below, filed as its own ticket so it can be claimed and closed like the rest.
  It touches `ClaudeProvider.kt`, which PR #38 also touches. **PR #38 has not merged** — its
  commits exist only on `JMAN730/to-spec-branch-name`. Either wait for #38 to merge and
  branch from `main`, or branch from `JMAN730/to-spec-branch-name` now. Branching from
  `main` today conflicts at merge time, or silently drops #38's model-ID migration in a
  rebase.

### Blocked

- **#43** AgentLoop response to each error category — blocked by #31 (#30 now closed).
- **#34** Assemble the API reliability spec — blocked by #31, #32, #43.
- **#15** Grant all permissions feature — implementation, wants #24's spec first.
- **#17** crash log — closes when PR #36 merges.
- **#16 / #35** Claude catalog — close when PR #38 merges. #35 is the binding spec (20 user
  stories); #16's scope section is superseded by it.
- **#25**, **#18** — maps, close when their children do. #18 needs only #24.

### One open question for you

**#34 is titled "Assemble the API reliability spec and post upstream."** `AGENTS.md`
forbids writing to `yashab-cyber/opendroid`. Map #25's Destination says the spec is posted
as a comment on upstream issue 13, and notes you have merge rights upstream — so the map and
the agent rules disagree. Nothing has been posted upstream. Decide before #34 runs.

## How to resume

Run one agent per ticket, but **serially or two at a time**, not ten — the parallel load is
what killed this session three times. Each agent should:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. Pass `--repo JMAN730/opendroid` on every `gh issue` and `gh pr` call. Not on `gh api`,
   which has no such flag and exits with an unknown-flag error — put the repository in the
   endpoint path there instead (`repos/JMAN730/opendroid/...`).
3. Post its findings comment and close its issue **before** polishing, so an interruption
   cannot lose the result. Commit and push incrementally for code tickets.
4. **Not edit map bodies.** This overrides the **Resolve** step in
   `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, which tells a `/wayfinder` session to append its own
   context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far. Concurrent ticket agents editing one
   issue body race and lose each other's edits, so during a sweep the append is deferred
   instead. Post the context pointer as a comment on the ticket you just closed, where the
   central pass can find it.
5. The **driving session** — whoever is running the sweep, not the per-ticket agents — owns
   the map edits. Do them after each batch of tickets closes, reading the pointers off the
   closed tickets' comments. Do not leave them all to the end of the sweep: an interrupted
   session then loses the entire Decisions-so-far update, which is the failure this handoff
   exists to recover from.
