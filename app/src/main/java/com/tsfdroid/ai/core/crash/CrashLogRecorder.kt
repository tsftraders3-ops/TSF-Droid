/**
 * Builds a [CrashLogRecord] from an uncaught exception and hands it to a [CrashLogSink].
 *
 * Every failure is swallowed. This code runs between the exception becoming
 * uncaught and the system handler killing the process; anything thrown here
 * would replace a real, diagnosable crash with a useless one from the crash
 * logger itself.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Android APIs - reporting a recording failure goes through
 * [onRecordingFailed] rather than `android.util.Log` so the whole class stays
 * exercisable from plain JVM unit tests.
