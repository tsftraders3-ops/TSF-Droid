     * (COMPLETED, FAILED, or CANCELLED).

     * That terminal-status guard is load-bearing, not defensive dressing: unlike

     * cancelCurrentTask() is documented as "safe to call when nothing is

     * [_currentPlan] is the *last finished* plan (PlanScreen intentionally keeps
     * showing it there after completion - see updatePlanStatus). Without this
     * guard, a call with nothing actually in flight would relabel that finished
     * plan CANCELLED and persist that lie over its real COMPLETED/FAILED row.

     * move it to a different status again.

     * [expectedPlanId], when non-null, adds a second, independent guard: this
     * only applies CANCELLED when the plan currently held here is STILL the one
     * identified by that id. AgentLoop's cancellation paths (cancelCurrentTask,
     * abandonWaitingTask, resolveStaleProposedPlan) fire their join-then-cancel
     * follow-up on a separate coroutine that can run arbitrarily later than the
     * moment cancellation was actually requested - by then a brand-new,
     * completely unrelated task may already have replaced [_currentPlan] via
     * [startNewPlan]. Without this check, cancelPlan() would happily relabel
     * that new plan CANCELLED (the terminal-status guard above does NOT catch
     * this - a fresh plan starts RUNNING, not terminal) purely because it
     * happened to be whatever was "current" when this coroutine got around to
     * running. Passing null keeps the old "cancel whatever is current"
     * behaviour for any caller that genuinely means that.
