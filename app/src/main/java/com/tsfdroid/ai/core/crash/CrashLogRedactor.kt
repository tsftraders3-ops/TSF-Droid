/**
 * Strips credential material out of text on its way into the crash log.
 *
 * This matters because the crash log is a *sharing* sink, not just a storage
 * one: a record is rendered on screen, copied to the clipboard, and put into an
 * `ACTION_SEND` intent aimed at an arbitrary third-party app. Anything a
 * provider echoed back into an exception message travels with it.
 *
 * The exposure is not hypothetical. Several providers build their failure
 * messages straight out of the response body - for example
 * `IOException("OpenAI request failed: Code ${'$'}{response.code} - ${'$'}responseBody")`
 * in `OpenAIProvider` - and OpenAI's 401 body echoes a partially masked copy of
 * the submitted key. Gemini goes further and carries its key in the request URL
 * (`GeminiProvider.kt`, `?key=${'$'}apiKey`), so any message quoting that URL
 * carries the key verbatim.
 *
 * Redaction happens at capture time rather than at share time, so the secret
 * never reaches the database in the first place. There is no un-redacted copy to
 * leak later.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: it targets shapes that are unambiguously credential
 * material. A blanket "long random-looking token" rule would shred ordinary
 * stack frames. That means this is a mitigation, not a guarantee - a provider
 * that echoes an unprefixed key (Cohere's are bare alphanumerics) still gets
 * through. The project-wide rule is being decided in issue #40; this class is
 * the crash-log sink's share of it and should be folded into that rule when it
 * lands.
