     * comes from the wall clock, which can move backwards - a device correcting
     * a clock that was set into the future gives the newest row the largest
     * `id` but an older `timestamp`. Ordering retention by `timestamp` would
     * then rank that row outside the keep set and delete the crash that just
     * happened. Insertion order cannot go backwards, so it is the safe key
     * here; the read queries still order by `timestamp` for presentation.
