/**
 * Persists crashes to Room from the crashing thread.
 *
 * `runBlocking` is correct here rather than a lazy coroutine launch: the system
 * handler kills the process the moment this returns, so a write that has not
 * completed by then is a write that never happens.
 *
 * Blocking on a *suspend* DAO function is also what keeps this legal on the main
 * thread - Room dispatches suspend queries to its own executor, so its
 * "cannot access database on the main thread" guard does not apply. Most crashes
 * are main-thread crashes, so that detail is load-bearing.
